     <h2><b>Hope in Darkness</b></h2>
     <p>In the world of novels and movies, we often come across various characters and while some aren't that relabtable, some leave an impressionable impact on us and manage to stay with us long after we are done watching a series or movie or reading a book.</p>
     <p>Though most narratives never cease to highlight the contrasting difference between light and dark, some realise that the world isn't as light or dark, there are shades of grey. These shows delve deeper into character development and give its audiences a true understanding of each character's circumstances. In these portrayals, all the questions of viewers or readers are answered and that makes these shows so special in people's heart.</p>
     <p>The shades of grey sets a tone in the narrative of a plot and is often traced back to the popular Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The realism that is adapted, makes the leads not so ideally perfect and much more human. This website is solely dedicated to highlight the most underrated characters and to celebrate the light in their darkness.</p> 
     <p>The characters we will focus on are :</p>
     <dl>
      <dt>Draco Lucius Malfoy</dt>
