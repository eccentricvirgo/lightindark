     <h2><b>The God's Favourite Child</b></h2>
     <img height="210" width="300" src="lucifer.jpg" alt="Lucifer"/>      
     <p>The very birth of darkness in the human realm started with Lucifer's defiance. Lucifer Morningstar, the most gifted and influential child of God who also happened to be his favourite too, defied god and took half of heaven with him to hell. The irony of it is as amusing as it is terrifying. The beginning of corruption and darkness started from unsorted parental issues between god and his child.</p>
     <p>Lucifer's irritation and dislike towards god stems from his need to live without interference and manipulations of his father who never ceases to manipulate him. The situation worsens so much so that Lucifer leaves his home and heads for hell to be farthest away from his father. He also tries to cut off his wings to completely sever ties from heaven and be free of its influences.</p>
     <p>While his actions led to corruption in humans, he however, isn't responsible for the sins humans commit. He is in fact the punisher for those who sin and not an instigator of sin. His influence over mankind is often misinterpreted and hence he became so infamously known as 'The Devil'.</p>
